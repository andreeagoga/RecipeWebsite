        <h2>Description</h2>
        <article id="description-content">
            <p>It's time to put that waffle iron languishing in the back of your cabinet to good use. These airy,
                delicate and crisp-edged waffles are so fabulous, yet so simple to throw together, they're destined to
                become part of your weekend breakfast routine. Freeze leftovers, if you have any, in Ziplock bags and
                serve them during the week. You can pop them in the toaster to reheat (use a light setting) and they
                come out nearly as well as freshly made, maybe even slightly crunchier.</p>
            <p>For a lighter, fluffier waffle, separate the eggs and proceed with step 2 using the egg yolks. Beat the
                whites until stiff, then fold into the batter. For whole-grain waffles, use 1 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
                and 2/3 cup whole-wheat flour. You can also substitute brown sugar for the granulated.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter either on the stove or in the microwave. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. In a separate
                    bowl, whisk together yogurt, milk, melted butter, and eggs. Fold wet ingredients into dry
                    ingredients.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat a waffle iron and, using a pastry brush or paper towel, lightly coat with butter. Cook
                    waffles (using about 1/2 cup batter per waffle) until golden and crisp. Butter the iron in between
                    batches as needed. Serve waffles immediately as they are ready, or keep them warm in a 200 degree
                    oven until ready to serve.
