        <h2>Description</h2>
        <article id="description">
            <p>The basic pancake is made from a simple batter of eggs, flour, milk and baking powder for leavening. You
                can use different types of flour if you want to experiment with whole wheat or buckwheat. And you can
                also add fruit to the mixture. The batter can be made from scratch in about the same time it takes to
                make toast. The most time-consuming part of making pancakes, of course, is cooking them. But that time
                is so short you should consider these an everyday convenience food, not a special-occasion feast. Cook
                this recipe a few times and it may become part of your weekly routine.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <article id="ingredients">
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li> 2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li> ¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar, optional</li>
                <li> 2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 ½ to 2 cups milk</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <article id="steps">
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. In a bowl, mix together dry ingredients. Beat
                    eggs into 1 1/2 cups milk, then stir in 2 tablespoons melted cooled butter, if using it. Gently stir
                    this mixture into dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten flour; don't worry about a few
                    lumps. If batter seems thick, add a little more milk.
                </li>
                <li>Place a teaspoon or 2 of butter or oil on griddle or skillet. When butter foam subsides or oil
                    shimmers, ladle batter onto griddle or skillet, making pancakes of any size you like. Adjust heat as
                    necessary; usually, first batch will require higher heat than subsequent batches. Flip pancakes
                    after bubbles rise to surface and bottoms brown, after 2 to 4 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Cook until second side is lightly browned. Serve, or hold on an ovenproof plate in a 200-degree oven
                    for up to 15 minutes.
                </li>
            </ol>
